While we did not complete the frontend of our project, here is the general idea:

Reminder web application to record & remind about your pet's next vaccine appointment.
Planned to have SMS and Email reminders 1 week before and day of the vaccination
Used standard vaccination frequencies to determine reminder periods


Our website aims to solve the issue of missing multi-dose vaccine appointments for your pets. Pets require a series of vaccinations separated over a duration of several weeks, months or years. Keeping track of the various vaccines could get inconvenient and missing a vaccine dose could have adverse outcomes. This website will remind you to book an appointment for your petsâ€™ vaccination, a week in advance based on the required type of vaccination. A reminder is sent over email and SMS to ensure your pets receive the vaccine they need, on time.

### Technologies Used?
-GitHub
-Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
-React, Bootstrap
-Insomnia
### Setbacks
Learning most of the technology for the first time
Focused on backend for majority of the work time; had some time-management issues
Difference in environment caused different bugs to appear on each machine
Last minute idea/planning: idea was not finalized until 1-2 hours into hacking period
### Successes
Completed the backend; APIs and appointment update algorithm are functional
Successfully implemented an auto-emailer and auto-SMS messenger
Had fun, learned a lot
